# Hangman Game Project in Java

This is a project to write a Hangman game logic in Java, which allows a user to play it in a console. A player is prompt to select whether he/she wants to play the game by guessing a letter or a whole word. Unless a player confirms the option, it won't start a game.

Once the game is started, the question word is selected from a local txt file randomly and every turn of the game will be logged in a separate txt file with the following information:

- Question Word
- Result of the game
- Number of Guess Made
